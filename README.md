# Smarter Raider AI
(Formally 'All Raids Can Breach')	
Tynan says Rimworld is a storyteller, not a skill test. This mod is for people who want it to be both.

All enemy pawns will now avoid areas your turrets or drafted pawns have line of sight to (leveraging and extending the avoid grid normally only used in smart raids). Yes this means no more killboxes. If there is no suitable path they will breach or sap. This also means opening one door where you have all your pawns waiting will not work either, unless the alternative pathways into your base are so tedious there literally is no other option, i.e. you are a mountain base with one entrance 10 tiles deep.

All raids also now have the ability to breach assuming they contain any pawns with weapons enabled for breaching (see mod options). Default breach weapon keywords are "stickbomb, concussion, frag, rocket, inferno, chargeblast, thermal, thump". You may customise these but note if you are running CE and you choose weapon types with limited ammo the raiders may waste all their ammo on breaching. Also note this does not change the types of raiders that spawn, only adds breaching as an option to the raider decision making tree.

Raiders will also not beeline to colonists like they used to, they will attack colonists within line of sight but if none available will focus on pillaging the colony.

Due to all of the above it is much harder to 'Game' the AI. Strategic defence of the whole colony and not just one entrance is very important.

Can add/remove from save without issue.

Compatible with combat extended.
